    "# Fitting the distribution of heights data\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment you will write code to perform a steepest descent to fit a Gaussian model to the distribution of heights data that was first introduced in *Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is the same as you encountered in *Gradient descent in a sandpit* but this time instead of descending a pre-defined function, we shall descend the $\\chi^2$ (chi squared) function which is both a function of the parameters that we are to optimise, but also the data that the model is to fit to.\n",
