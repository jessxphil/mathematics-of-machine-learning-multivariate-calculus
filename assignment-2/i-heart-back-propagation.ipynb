## Instructions

In this assignment, you will train a neural network to draw a curve.
The curve takes one input variable, the amount travelled along the curve from 0 to 1, and returns 2 outputs, the 2D coordinates of the position of points on the curve.

To help capture the complexity of the curve, we shall use two hidden layers in our network with 6 and 7 neurons respectively.

![Neural network with 2 hidden layers. There is 1 nodes in the zeroth layer, 6 in the first, 7 in the second, and 2 in the third.](readonly/bigNet.png "The structure of the network we will consider in this assignment.")

You will be asked to complete functions that calculate the Jacobian of the cost function, with respect to the weights and biases of the network. Your code will form part of a stochastic steepest descent algorithm that will train your network.

### Matrices in Python
Recall from assignments in the previous course in this specialisation that matrices can be multiplied together in two ways.

Element wise: when two matrices have the same dimensions, matrix elements in the same position in each matrix are multiplied together
In python this uses the '$*$' operator.
```python
A = B * C
```

Matrix multiplication: when the number of columns in the first matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second.
In python this uses the '$@$' operator
```python
A = B @ C
```

This assignment will not test which ones to use where, but it will use both in the starter code presented to you.
There is no need to change these or worry about their specifics.

### How to submit
To complete the assignment, edit the code in the cells below where you are told to do so.
Once you are finished and happy with it, press the **Submit Assignment** button at the top of this worksheet.
Test your code using the cells at the bottom of the notebook before you submit.

Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the grading script.

## Feed forward

In the following cell, we will define functions to set up our neural network.
Namely an activation function, $\sigma(z)$, it's derivative, $\sigma'(z)$, a function to initialise weights and biases, and a function that calculates each activation of the network using feed-forward.

Recall the feed-forward equations,
$$ \mathbf{a}^{(n)} = \sigma(\mathbf{z}^{(n)}) $$
$$ \mathbf{z}^{(n)} = \mathbf{W}^{(n)}\mathbf{a}^{(n-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(n)} $$

In this worksheet we will use the *logistic function* as our activation function, rather than the more familiar $\tanh$.
$$ \sigma(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\mathbf{z})} $$

There is no need to edit the following cells.
They do not form part of the assessment.
You may wish to study how it works though.

**Run the following cells before continuing.**

## Backpropagation

In the next cells, you will be asked to complete functions for the Jacobian of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases.
We will start with layer 3, which is the easiest, and work backwards through the layers.

We'll define our Jacobians as,
$$ \mathbf{J}_{\mathbf{W}^{(3)}} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(3)}} $$
$$ \mathbf{J}_{\mathbf{b}^{(3)}} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(3)}} $$
etc., where $C$ is the average cost function over the training set. i.e.,
$$ C = \frac{1}{N}\sum_k C_k $$
You calculated the following in the practice quizzes,
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(3)}} =
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(3)}}
   ,$$
for the weight, and similarly for the bias,
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(3)}} =
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(3)}}
   .$$
With the partial derivatives taking the form,
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}} = 2(\mathbf{a}^{(3)} - \mathbf{y}) $$
$$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}} = \sigma'({z}^{(3)})$$
$$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(3)}} = \mathbf{a}^{(2)}$$
$$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(3)}} = 1$$

We'll do the J_W3 ($\mathbf{J}_{\mathbf{W}^{(3)}}$) function for you, so you can see how it works.
You should then be able to adapt the J_b3 function, with help, yourself.

# GRADED FUNCTION

# Jacobian for the third layer weights. There is no need to edit this function.
def J_W3 (x, y) :
    # First get all the activations and weighted sums at each layer of the network.
    a0, z1, a1, z2, a2, z3, a3 = network_function(x)
    # We'll use the variable J to store parts of our result as we go along, updating it in each line.
    # Firstly, we calculate dC/da3, using the expressions above.
    J = 2 * (a3 - y)
    # Next multiply the result we've calculated by the derivative of sigma, evaluated at z3.
    J = J * d_sigma(z3)
    # Then we take the dot product (along the axis that holds the training examples) with the final partial derivative,
    # i.e. dz3/dW3 = a2
    # and divide by the number of training examples, for the average over all training examples.
    J = J @ a2.T / x.size
    # Finally return the result out of the function.
    return J

# In this function, you will implement the jacobian for the bias.
# As you will see from the partial derivatives, only the last partial derivative is different.
# The first two partial derivatives are the same as previously.
# ===YOU SHOULD EDIT THIS FUNCTION===
def J_b3 (x, y) :
    # As last time, we'll first set up the activations.
    a0, z1, a1, z2, a2, z3, a3 = network_function(x)
    # Next you should implement the first two partial derivatives of the Jacobian.
    # ===COPY TWO LINES FROM THE PREVIOUS FUNCTION TO SET UP THE FIRST TWO JACOBIAN TERMS===
    J = 2 * (a3 - y)
    J = J * d_sigma(z3)
    # For the final line, we don't need to multiply by dz3/db3, because that is multiplying by 1.
    # We still need to sum over all training examples however.
    # There is no need to edit this line.
    J = np.sum(J, axis=1, keepdims=True) / x.size
    return J

Layer 1 is very similar to Layer 2, but with an addition partial derivative term.
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(1)}} =
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}
   \left(
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(2)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(2)}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(1)}}
   \right)
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(1)}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(1)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(1)}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(1)}}
   ,$$
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(1)}} =
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}
   \left(
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(3)}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(2)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(2)}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(1)}}
   \right)
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{(1)}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(1)}}
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{(1)}}{\partial \mathbf{b}^{(1)}}

You should be able to adapt lines from the previous cells to complete **both** the weight and bias Jacobian.
