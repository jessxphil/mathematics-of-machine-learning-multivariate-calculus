Here's a peak into what you'll learn in the course! Understanding calculus is central to understanding machine learning. You can think of calculus as simply a set of tools for analysing the relationship between functions and their inputs. Often, in machine learning, we are trying to find the inputs which enable a function to best match the data. In the image above, the Sandbox exercise will build an understanding of what the Jacobian is, and how this can be used to find the minimum of a function by clicking on any point in the sandpit, and thereby measuring the negative of the Jacobian. 

## Objectives

<b>Week 1:</b> Recall the definition of differentiation. Apply differentiation to simple functions. Describe the utility of time saving rules. Apply sum, product and chain rule. 

<b>Week 2:</b> Recognize that differentiation can be applied to multiple variables in an equation. Use multivariate calculus tools on example equations. Recognise the utility of vector/matrix structures in multivariate calculus. Examine two dimensional problems using the Jacobian. 

<b>Week 3:</b>

<b>Week 4:</b>
